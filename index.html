        As covid-19 has spread around the world, people have become grimly familiar with the death tolls that their governments publish each day. These numbers give a better indication of a country’s trajectory than do counts of confirmed cases, which largely measure how many people have been tested. Nonetheless, official covid-19 death tolls still under-count the true number of fatalities that the disease has already caused at that point.
        </p>

        <p class="text">
        In many places, official daily figures exclude anybody who did not die in hospital or who did not test positive. Often the cause of death takes several days to establish, which creates a lag in the data. And even the most complete covid-19 records will not count people who were killed by other conditions that probably would have been treated successfully, had hospitals not been overwhelmed by a surge of patients needing intensive care.

        So far, Italy’s national statistical bureau has published figures of deaths from all causes for only 1,700 of the country’s 7,900 municipalities, covering the period until April 4th. We have analysed a sample of these areas, including Bergamo, which contain 7.2m of the 10m residents in Lombardy, the worst-affected region. Between March 1st (the week Lombardy passed 50 official fatalities) and April 4th, this sample suffered about 6,100 official covid-19 deaths, according to our estimate. In the same period, it registered 12,800 excess deaths. This suggests that the official numbers captured 48% of the true estimated excess.
